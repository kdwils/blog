# Who
My name is Kyle and I am a software engineer. Professionally, I work on a variety of things such as developing pipelines, automating software supply chain governance, and improving the developer experience when it comes to pushing code from the laptop to production. Casually, I like to spend my free time working on my homelab (okay its just a couple of raspberry pis).

Born and raised in Pennsylvania. Go 'lers.

# What

This blog is a space for me to write about the tech things that I do at home. It serves as both documentation and a roadmap of my experiences as I learn new things.

I am also interested in writing about my cancer experience and may add posts in the future.

# Where
Most of my code and homelab infra configs are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/kdwils).

# When

There's no time like the present to make a blog.

# Why

 I'm not sure that anyone will ever read my posts.. but I am hoping that they help out at least one person. I found that tech blogs were often much more successful in helping me with my homelab than whatever official documentation was available and so I want to return the favor.
